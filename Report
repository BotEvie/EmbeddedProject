Embedded Project Report

Scope
In Dr. Sean Carroll’s Embedded Systems class, we were tasked with using embedded design techniques to create a multi-tasking 
device that provided the best functionality, usability, reliability, performance, and supportability as well as follow JPL guidelines. 
To accomplish this, we created a device that used an accelerometer such that when the device was moved or picked up the device would 
generate a square wave which would then be heard on a speaker. More specifically, our chip would read SPI from the accelerometer which 
would then enable pulse width modulation through TIM22 and produce a square wave to pin PA6. The success and proper function of our 
device is measured by the time between the input and output. If the wave has the proper amplitude and frequency, the user of the device 
should hear the generated wave from the speaker within roughly 0.7 milliseconds.

Next Step
If given more time for the project, we would implement the ability to change amplitudes and frequencies based on the speed and direction 
the accelerometer is moved. For example, if the accelerometer was moved really fast the frequency of the sound generate would be higher or 
if the accelerometer was moved in the x-axis direction the amplitude of the sound would be larger than the amplitude of the sound if the 
accelerometer were to be moved in the y-axis direction. To achieve, we would have to pass different SPI values received from the accelerometer 
that would then change the duty cycle of the pulse width modulation or the clock pre-scale divider; thus, changing the amplitude, or loudness, 
and the frequency of the sound generated.  Implementing and changing tasks would take some time to figure out, but if given another 4-6 weeks to 
work, this could be completed.
