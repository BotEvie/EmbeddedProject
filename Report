Embedded Project Report

Scope
In Dr. Sean Carroll’s Embedded Systems class, we were tasked with using embedded design techniques to create a multi-tasking device that provided the best functionality,
usability, reliability, performance, and supportability as well as follow JPL guidelines. To accomplish this, we created a device that used an accelerometer such that
when the device was moved or picked up the device would generate a triangular wave which would then be heard on a speaker. More specifically, our chip would read an ADC
value from the accelerometer and the DAC would out the triangular wave to pin PA4. The success and proper function of our device is measured by the time between the
input and output. If the wave has the proper amplitude and frequency, the user of the device should hear the generated wave from the speaker within milliseconds.
