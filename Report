Embedded Project Report

Scope
In Dr. Sean Carroll’s Embedded Systems class, we were tasked with using embedded design techniques to create a multi-tasking 
device that provided the best functionality, usability, reliability, performance, and supportability as well as follow JPL guidelines. 
To accomplish this, we created a device that used an accelerometer such that when the device was moved or picked up the device would 
generate a square wave which would then be heard on a speaker. More specifically, our chip would read SPI from the accelerometer which 
would then enable pulse width modulation through TIM22 and produce a square wave to pin PA6. The success and proper function of our 
device is measured by the time between the input and output. If the wave has the proper amplitude and frequency, the user of the device 
should hear the generated wave from the speaker within roughly 0.7 milliseconds.
